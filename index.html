        Happy Valley Shelter has been finding safe and loving homes 
        for dogs in the Piedmont area since 1989. 
        We work in cooperation with local county shelters and rescue 
        organizations and specialize in caring for neglected and 
        abandoned dogs.</p>

        <p class="home-text">
            At Happy Valley, our staff are trained in all aspects of 
            animal welfare and can give you expert advice on adoption, 
            training, and care. We are proud of the work we do at 
            Happy Valley and are grateful to our community for their 
            support in helping us achieve our mission.</p>
    
        <p class="home-text">
            We take great care in matching each dog with the right 
            family to ensure a successful adoption. We believe that 
            every dog deserves a loving home, and we work tirelessly 
            to make that a reality.</p>
